# GroupTranslationDB
A list of vMenu translations by the lovely FiveM/Cfx.re Community Members

# Purpose
Ever since the PF-0.1.3 version of vMenu got released, we have added Language Support to the menu for easier understanding, as some people do not understand or barely speak the English language. This update enables more languages to be welcomed to FiveM. Everyone deserves to use the vMenu and understand how it works.

# How to Contribute
Please open a pull request! The [template file](https://github.com/ProjectFairnessLabs/GroupTranslationDB/blob/main/languages/TEMPLATE.json) is available for download, and you can open a pull request to make some new changes. This lets anyone make any changes and improve the translations, so the languages are more accurate than ever.
